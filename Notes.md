# Intro to Relational Database
## Normalized Design
1. Every row has the same number of columns.
2. There is a **unique** key, and everything in a row says something about the key.
3. Facts that don't relate to the key belong in different tables.
4. Tables shouldn't imply relationship that don't exist.
